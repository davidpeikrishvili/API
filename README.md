# Created a simple Anime API that is able to show the user basic information about the anime.
# The endpoints that were tested include { api/info, api/theme, api/info/{integer value}, api/theme/{integer value}.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ENDPOINTS]
# api/info = gets infromation from the first table which includes basic stuff about the anime
# api/theme = gets information from the second table which includes additional information concerning themes,genres,etc...
# api/info/{integer value} = gets specific anime corresponding to that integer value.
# api/theme/{integer value} = gets specific anime theme corresponding to that integer value. Both should match each other.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[HTTP Methods]
# The three methods that I used for this API were PUT/GET/DELETE
# All worked as intended. The GET method got the information, the PUT method updated or added additional anime, and DELETE deleted it and returned nothing in the body.
