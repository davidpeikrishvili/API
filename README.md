- Created a simple Anime API that is able to show the user basic information about the anime.
- The endpoints that were tested include { api/info, api/theme, api/info/{integer value}, api/theme/{integer value}.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ENDPOINTS]
- api/info = gets infromation from the first table which includes basic stuff about the anime
- api/theme = gets information from the second table which includes additional information concerning themes,genres,etc...
- api/info/{integer value} = gets specific anime corresponding to that integer value.
- api/theme/{integer value} = gets specific anime theme corresponding to that integer value. Both should match each other.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[HTTP Methods]
- The three methods that I used for this API were POST/GET/DELETE
- All worked as intended. The GET method got the information, the POST adds an anime , and DELETE deleted it and returned nothing in the body.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Files Included]
- All the VS Studio controllers and Models, and SQL workbench code itself.

[UPDATE]
-Had some errors after completing but fixed them and added aditional things to the API before presentation.
